1. The keyword new is used when creating an object.

2. False, in many cases recursive functions have multiple base cases.

3. Yes, s == null returns true.

4. Yes, a class can be used as the type of an instance variable in another class (Ex: Vector type in class Starship).

5. An instance variable should be initialized in the class method of the same name as the class or in some other method within the class. 

6. This is a reserved word in Java. That is not.

7. 
class Rectangle { 
    private double width; 
    private double height; 

    public Rectangle(double w, double h) { 
        width = w; 
        height = h; 
    } 
    
    public double perimeter() {
        double perimeter = 0;
        perimeter = this.width * 2 + this.height * 2;
        return perimeter;
    }
}

8. Absolutely! Many times constructors are overloaded to allow for inputs.

9. a. No b. Yes c. Yes d. Yes

10. An interface is a set of functions with nothing inside them. Interfaces provide templates for classes to follow.
